### *Description*
We had a 24hr hackathon to create a full stack application using a React frontend, Postgres database, and a Python Flask backend.  We came up with Honeydew! Need somewhere to track your "honey-do's"?  Honeydew is sweet— but not too sweet, with only the bells and whistles you need.

Honeydew allows users to login to view their personalized to-do lists.  They can add different lists and then add and/or delete todos for that list.

### *Technologies Used*
* PostgreSQL
* Flask
* React Redux
* NodeJs 
***

### *Getting Started*
* To get started, create an account
